## What's in this Project?

This project contains Python programs that solve various programming problems. Think of it as a collection of small tools and puzzles that help learn Python programming. The problems are divided into two sets:

### Set A: Basic Stuff (The Fundamentals)
1. **Calculator**: A simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
2. **Number Converter**: Converts regular numbers to binary (like converting 5 to 101)
3. **Age Checker**: Tells if someone is a kid, adult, or senior citizen
4. **Number Swapper**: Swaps two numbers without using extra space
5. **Fibonacci**: Prints the famous Fibonacci sequence (like 0,1,1,2,3,5,...)
6. **Prime Checker**: Tells if a number is prime or not
7. **Sum Checker**: Checks if two numbers add up to a third number
8. **Factorial**: Calculates factorial of a number (like 5! = 5Ã—4Ã—3Ã—2Ã—1)
9. **Safe Division**: Divides numbers while handling errors
10. **Max Finder**: Finds the biggest number in a list
11. **Greeter**: Says hello with your name and age
12. **Vowel Counter**: Counts how many vowels are in a word
13. **Times Table**: Shows multiplication tables
14. **Star Pattern**: Makes a triangle using stars (*)
15. **Pyramid**: Makes a pyramid using stars (*)

### Set B: Coding Challenges (The Fun Stuff)
1. **Palindrome**: Checks if a number reads the same forwards and backwards
2. **Unique Finder**: Finds the one unique number in a list of pairs
3. **Number Pairs**: Finds two numbers that add up to a target
4. **Happy Numbers**: A fun math puzzle about "happy" numbers
5. **Duplicate Checker**: Checks if any number appears twice in a list

## How to Use This?

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open the `Assignment.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each program one by one
4. Type in numbers or text when asked

## What You Need
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

That's it! Each program is like a small tool that helps learn different parts of Python programming. Have fun trying them out! ðŸ˜Š

## Custom Modules

### factorial_module.py
```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```
- Custom module for factorial calculation
